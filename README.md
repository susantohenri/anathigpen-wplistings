## Description ##

<em>The IMPress Listings plugin has been deprecated. The features of IMPress Listings will soon be consolidated with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum/">IMPress for IDX Broker</a>.</em>

Have full control of how your featured listings are presented on your real estate WordPress website.

IMPress Listings creates a fully responsive listing management system and works with nearly any WordPress theme. The plugin allows MLS integration through the use of the [IMPress for IDX Broker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum/) plugin. IMPress Listings also allows for manual entry and management of listings directly within the WordPress interface.

### Demo ###

> **Importing from your MLS**
> No more typing in listing information that you have already added to your MLS. With IMPress Listings and IMPress for IDX Broker, you can automatically import listing details.
>
> *IDX Broker subscription required.

### Default Taxonomies and Terms ###

* Status (Active, Sold, Pending, For Rent, Reduced, New)
* Property Types (Residential, Condo, Townhome, Commercial)
* Location
* Features

Use the taxonomy creation tool to create your own way of classifying listings (i.e. bedrooms, bathrooms, locations, price ranges) and use those taxonomies to allow users to search for listings. Then, reorder the taxonomies as needed.

Find listings by taxonomy using filters in the WordPress admin.

### Google My Business ###

Connect IMPress Listings to your verified Google My Business profile to generate and schedule timely posts, photos of your listings, and more.

The automatic scheduler can be used to create and share posts to highlight featured listings, open house announcements, recent sales, local expertise, and more.

Posts have the potential to bring leads and clients directly to your IDX-enabled website for more home search opportunities. Google My Business posts are archived on a weekly basis, so automating the process with the scheduler is an easy way to maintain your real estate businessâ€™s online presence.

* Automatic posting requires a verified Google My Business account with a verified location.

### Migrating from AgentPress Listings ###

If you're using the [AgentPress Listings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/agentpress-listings/) plugin, we've made it easy to switch to IMPress Listings. The plugin uses the same post type name and data fields (plus several more) so all your entered listing data will remain in place.

### Property Display ###

IMPress Listings automatically creates individual listings pages for your imported properties that can be managed in your WordPress dashboard. These pages can be linked, shared or searched from anywhere else on your site.

Choose to show or hide specific fields (pricing, square ft, etc.) with one click.

Supported property fields:
* Price
* Address
* Country
* MLS Number
* Year Built
* Floors
* Square Feet
* Lot Square Feet
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Half Baths
* Garage
* Pool
* Open House date and time
* Photo gallery
* Video or virtual tour
* Map
* and more!

### Contact Forms ###

Listing pages include a contact form for visitors to inquire about a property, or the form can be replaced with your own form plugin shortcode.

Save time by adding a contact form to all listings instead of one at a time.

### Flair for Developers ###

A lot of developer goodies came in WordPress 4.4, including API support. Developers looking to use the latest WordPress tools will love IMPress Listings.

We have built in WordPress API support for the listing post type and default taxonomies. This will allow skilled developers to create their own applications around listing content.

There is also support for taxonomy featured images. Assign an image for active properties, solds, featured listings, neighborhoods, or any other taxonomy you might create.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the entire `wp-listings` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Begin creating listings and listing taxonomies

### How to use the listings shortcode ###

### Basic usage ###
Just enter the following shortcode on any post or page

`[listings]`

### Advanced usage ###
The shortcode accepts the following parameters:

`id` = listing post id (accepts one or more id's), exclusive, cannot be combined with other parameters, except for columns
`limit` = limit the number of posts to show, defaults to all
`columns` = display output in columns, accepts values 2-6, default is 1 column
`taxonomy` = taxonomy to display (must be used with the term parameter)
`term` = term to display (must be used with the taxonomy parameter)

Example advanced usage:
`[listings taxonomy="status" term="active" limit="10" columns="3"]`
This will display all listings in the "Status" taxonomy, assigned to the "Active" term, limited to 10 listings, in 3 columns

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Can I import listings from my MLS? ###

Yes. With an IDX Broker subscription and adding their IMPress for IDX Broker plugin to your site, IMPress Listings can import featured properties from the MLS.

### I already use the AgentPress Listings plugin, can I use this plugin? ###

Yes. This plugin can be used instead of the AgentPress Listings plugin. It uses the same post type name and custom field names (along with several new fields), so the posts you've added using AgentPress, along with the associated meta data, will remain attached to the listing post. Just be sure to deactivate AgentPress before activating IMPress Listings.

### How can I create a custom single listing template? ###

Name your template file `single-listing-CUSTOM-NAME.php` (replace CUSTOM NAME with your own descriptive name). You can use the single-listing.php within the plugins /includes/views/ folder for a guide on how to display the post type data. You'll need to include the following block of text at the top of your custom template:
`/*
Single Listing Template: Test Template
Description: Give it a description to help identify
*/`

### How can I remove the default property status terms or property type terms? ###

It's possible to remove the default property status terms by using a filter in your theme or custom plugins. Here is an example for the status terms:

`/* Remove Default Status Terms from IMPress Listings */
add_filter( 'wp_listings_default_status_terms', 'custom_default_status_terms' );
function custom_default_status_terms() {
  $status_terms = array();
  return $status_terms;
}`

Here is an example for the property terms:

`/* Remove Default Property Terms from IMPress Listings */
add_filter( 'wp_listings_default_property_type_terms', 'custom_default_property_type_terms' );
function custom_default_property_type_terms() {
  $property_type_terms = array();
  return $property_type_terms;
}`
